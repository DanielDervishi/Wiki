# Managing Groups

On this page, you will find useful information about how to manage your assignment or project groups on MarkUs.
Creating a group

Context: two students, Alice and Bob, are working together in a group for assignment "A1". On MarkUs, they must declare their group by doing the following.

1. (Alice) Log into MarkUs, and click on the "A1" link under Your Assignments

2. (Alice) In the Group Information pane on the right, click on the `Create` button.

3. (Alice) After the page refreshes, click on the Invite button. Enter the Bob's username and press `Submit`.

    **Warning**: At this point, Bob has been invited to the group, but that doesn't mean Bob is in the group! Even if Alice submits work, only she will get a mark; Bob won't if he hasn't accepted the invitation.

4. (Bob) Log into MarkUs, and click on the "A1" link.

5. (Bob) Click on the `Join` button underneath Alice's invitation.

At this point, the group has been declared, and both partners may begin submitting files.

**Only one group member should create a group by pressing the `Create` button.** Even if your group has three or more people, one group member is responsible for creating the group and inviting all other group members.
